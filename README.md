# Distributed Tracing Workshop 

This project contains all the material used in the Distributed Tracing Workshop.

In order to begin with go to this [link](https://alvsanand.github.io/distributed-tracing-workshop/).

## VuePress website

The documentation of this project is VuePress compliant. So you can use it in order to generate a static website instead of using the Markdown files.

### Generate site

- Launch compiler:

        ```sh
        yarn install
        yarn run build
        ```

### Launch site locally

- Start server

        ```sh
        yarn install
        yarn run start
        ```

- Open this [link](http://localhost:8080/).
