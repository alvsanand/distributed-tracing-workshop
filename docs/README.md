Distributed tracing, also called distributed request tracing, is a method used to profile and monitor applications, especially those built using a microservices architecture. Distributed tracing helps pinpoint where failures occur and what causes poor performance.

## Goals

Through this workshop you will be able to learn:

- What are distributed tracing and OpenTracing / Jaeger.
- How to install Jaeger into a local Kubernetes.
- How to use Jaeger.
- How to integrate your application into OpenTracing / Jaeger.
